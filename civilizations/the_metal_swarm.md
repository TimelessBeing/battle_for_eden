## Dedicated Mechanics:

- **Reconfigure a unit**
  - return a unit to your World
  - replace it with a combination of units
    of lesser or equal cost from your World
  - those units take the place of the reconfigured unit in its row,
    and their immediate abilities cannot be triggered
  - if the reconfigured unit was differentiated,
    the units that replace must be differentiated too,
    and all effects or abilities applying to the reconfigured unit
    now apply to them
