Dedicated Mechanics:

- Natural Energy is a temporary resource specific to your civilization.
  It is specific to the front on which it is generated,
  materialized by counter tokens placed near the unit cards on that front,
  and all the unspent Natural Energy is lost when the battle ends.

- "Gather Natural Energy" = generate 2 Natural Energy,
   +1 if one of the two territories engaged in battles,
   or 2 of the territories in direct contact with them,
   are forests (i.e. territories of your color)
