## Dedicated Mechanics:

- **Extract shards from a territory**
  - place 1 shard near the units on that front,
  - +1 if the territory is a mountain (*i.e.* a territory of your color),
  - +1 if the territoy is energy-rich
  - some abilities will allow you to spend those shards during battle;
    the remaining shards are given to the winner at the end of the battle

- **Use X Energy Crystal**
  - discard Energy Crystal cards from your hand for a total value of X or more

- **Place shards on a territory**
  - put the shards on that territory's tile
  - those shards may not be used by anyone.
  - if they want to, the owner of the territory may retrieve the shards
    during their turn of the Production phase,
    but only if that territory is connected to their Portal

- **Buying Energy Crystal cards:**
  - be aware that you are not allowed to purchase any Energy Crystal card
    during the Reinforcements phase, due to the Specialist permanent effect
