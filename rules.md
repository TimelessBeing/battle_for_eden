# Lore

Civilizations rise and fall across the multiverse.

Meanwhile, a place is left untouched, never knowing magic or technology.
A land filled with all kinds of riches, all kinds of resources,
and in which the ever so rare energy crystals are commonly found: a land called Eden!

At its center, at the very heart of Eden, energy is building up in its purest form.
When this energy starts resonating with natural formations throughout Eden,
and portals connecting it to the multiverse suddenly open,
it is time for civilizations to go to war!
War for crystals! War for resources! This is the battle for Eden!


#  How the game works

Battle For Eden is a conquest game involving moving troops
on a map of the world, Eden, and building your deck to improve
the quality of your army.

The game is played in two parts:

- first, the players first use hexagonal tiles to create a map of Eden,
  including the Heart of Eden and the portals connecting Eden to each civilization
- then, the conquest begins: players initially control the tiles near their
  portal, and to win they must either conquer and destroy all other portals
  (thus eliminating other civilizations's access to Eden)
  or extract enough pure energy from the Heart of Eden to become
  the uncontested sovereign of Eden


# Map creation

## Setup

Each player chooses a civilization and a color.
Players must then determine a first player in any way they choose.

Each player receives 1 tile of each of the 7 colors (including black),
which they shuffle and place as a face-down pile in front of them.
In addition to those tiles, each player receives a tile of the color they chose,
as well as the portal tile of their color, which they both place face-up in front of them.

The Heart of Eden tile is then placed at the center of the table.
It is the map's first tile, and it's now time to add the rest!


## Building the map

Starting from the first player, players take turns building the map.
During their turn, a player first draws a non-portal tile
— choosing to either draw the face-up one or one of the face down ones —
and adds it to the map by placing it in contact with another tile from the map.
They may then if they so choose add their portal tile to the map,
remove their portal tile from the map (if it is already part of it),
or do both (removing the tile then adding it elsewhere).

During map creation, players are only allowed to place tiles
in such locations that the following conditions are met:

- there must be at least 3 tiles between each portal tile and the Heart of Eden tile
- there must be at least 4 tiles between any two portal tiles
- each portal must be in contact with at most 2 tiles
- tiles cannot be placed in direct contact with a portal tile which is already on the map
- if a player's portal tile is already on the map, they are not allowed to place
  tiles on the map unless there is at least 3 tiles between the one they are placing
  and their own portal tile

While placing tiles, keep track of those which are energy-rich locations,
by putting an energy-rich-location token on any tile which is in contact
with tiles of at least 4 different types, including portal tiles
but excluding black tiles as well as the Heart of Eden tile.

After placing their last non-portal tile, players who haven't done so already
must add their portal tile to the map. If if is impossible to do so without
violating the previous conditions, they are given just enough black tiles
to make them able to place them then add their portal tile to the map
(1 black tile should generally be enough).

Each player - following turn order - is then given a last chance
to move their portal tile to another valid location if they so choose.

That's it, the map is done!
Now that we know what Eden looks like, let's move on to the conquest!


# Conquest

## Setup

The first player to have put their portal tile in their final location
during the map creation phase receives the first player token.

Common cards (Small Energy Crystal, Medium Energy Crystal, Huge Energy Crystal,
Setback and Opportunity) and technology cards
(Energy Shield, Temporary Rift, Improved Portal, Unmatched Power)
are placed around the map so that they are easy to access,
and each player receives his civilization's World
(i.e. the booklet containing that civilization's unit cards).

Each player then takes 3 Small Energy Crystal cards and 1 Medium Energy Crystal
from the common cards, 3 cost-1 units form their World, and shuffles
those cards into a deck, i.e. a pile which they place face-down in front of them.
They then draw 5 cards from the top of their decks to create their hand.
During the game, the player will play cards from their hands, which will
afterwards be discarded.
Discarded cards are placed face-up besided the deck, in the order they were
discarded (with the most recent one on top), forming the player's discard pile.

After that, each player receives 5 troops (i.e. cubes of their color),
which they place on their portal tile as well as the tiles in direct contact with it
(they may choose how they divide their troops, but there must be at least 1 troop per tile).


## Basics

Having at least 1 troop on a tile gives a player control of it,
making it their territory and allowing them to extract resources from it.

The conquest is a succession of rounds, each composed of the 3 same phases,
until a player wins. Those 3 phases are:

- the **Expansion phase**, in which players use their army to gain control of new territories
- the **Production phase**, in which the players' territories earns them resources
- the **Reinforcements phase**, in which the players' receive new troops and use those resources to improve their army

To gain time, the Production and Reinforcements phases can generally
be performed by all players at the same time, except if some of them want
to base their choices on the previous players'.

At the end of the Reinforcements phase, the 2nd player receives the 1st player token,
thus becoming the 1st player for the next round.

Now, let's get into more details.


## The Expansion phase

This is the phase during which players use their cards.

First, during their turn, a player may play any number
of Small/Medium/Large Energy Crystal cards from their hand,
placing those cards in front of them so that they can later
be used during the Reinforcement phase.
They may also discard any number of cards they want from their hand,
or return any number of unit cards from their hand to their World.

Then, if they want to, they can create battles on up to 2 fronts
(note: a front is a frontier on which there is an ongoing battle).

To create a battle on 1 front, the player chooses a frontier between
one of their territories and another territory they want to conquer.
They then leave at least 1 troop on the center of their territory
(which stays behind to occupy it), place the rest near the frontier,
and play a unit card from their hand to start the battle.

To create a battle on 2 fronts, the player proceeds similarly,
choosing 2 frontiers, leaving troops behind on the attacking territories,
placing troops near the frontiers, and playing a unit cards to start each battle.
If the player is attacking from the same territory at the same time,
they must divide the troops they place near the frontiers
and choose how much are sent to each front.

After the fronts are created, more units may then be added
(see section on Combat for more details),
then the strength of all units is tallied to determine who won on each front.
Each troop near the frontier gives a +1 bonus to the attacking side,
while each troop on the defending territory gives a +1 bonus to the defending side.

Once the winner on each front is known,
one troop from the losing side is removed from the corresponding tile.
If the attack against a territory is successful on at least 1 front, that territory is conquered.

Defending troops remaining on a conquered territory may be moved in any way by the defending
player to other territories that they control and which are in contact with the one they lost.
If there is none, the troops are simply removed from the tile.
If the conquered territory was the Heart of Eden,
the defending player must immediately spend all the pure energy they have
accumulated (see section on the Reinforcements phase for more details).

After successfully conquering a territory, the attacking player may freely divide
all troops attacking that territory between the territories they came from
and the conquered territory (possibly moving troops from one attacking territory
to another).

If the conquered territory was the defending player's portal territory,
then that player is eliminated from the game, and all that player's
remaining troops are replaced by troops from the attacking player.

After resolving the battles they created, the player may once again play any number
of Energy Crystal cards (which they may for example have drawn during the battle),
discard cards, or return unit cards from their hand to their World.

This is normally the end of the player's turn, in which case they replenish
their hand to 5 cards and we move on to the next player.
If there aren't enough cards to draw in the deck,
the player first shuffles their discard pile
(note: contrary to many other deckbuilding games, you are not forced
to discard the cards remaining in your hand and may keep any number of them).

However, if the player has taken at least 1 territory from other players
during their turn, they have a chance to continue their conquest if they want to,
but with some constraints:

- first, all Energy Crystal cards in front of them (those played during the turn)
  return to their hand
- then, they replenish their hand to 5 cards
- they now start a bonus turn, but this time they may only attack
  from the territories they took from other players during their previous turn
- during a bonus turn, starting battles has a cost:
  the player must first remove 1 troop from each attacking territory
  before sending troops to the frontier
  (2 if there are 2 fronts for that attacking territory)

Note that if they have enough troops and are successful in battle,
a player might be able to play many turns in a row.


## The Production phase

The territories a player controls are usually connected to the portal of that
player, i.e. there is a path from those territories to the player's portal
that goes only through that player's territories.
Sometimes however, after losing one or more territories,
some may become disconnected from the player's portal.

Each players receive 1 resource (materialized by ???) for each connected territory they control
(including their portal territory or the Heart of Eden),
plus 1 resource per connected territory of their color they control,
plus 1 resource per connected energy-rich location they control

In addition to that, a player controlling the Heart of Eden receives 1 pure energy
(materialized by a counter token) if that territory isn't disconnected,
which they place on the Heart of Eden.

To gain time, the Production phase is generally performed by all players
at the same time, except if some of them want to base their choices on the previous players'.


## The Reinforcements phase

During the Reinforcement phase, each player may purchase units
to increase the quality of their army.

To do so, they spend as much resources as the cost of the units they want
to purchase, then place those units in their discard pile in any order.
The maximum amount of resources that each player can spend on units during
the Reinforcements phase is determined by the Energy Crystal cards
they played during the Expansion phase: they cannot spend more
than the total values of those cards.

In addition to that the player may purchase one common card,
without cost limitations, again by spending as much resources
as the cost of the card they want to purchase then placing that card in their discard pile.
If they want, they may then purchase a second one for twice the price,
then a third one for 3 times the price, etc.

If the player controls the Heart of Eden,
they may also purchase technology cards by spending pure energy.

The player then discards the Energy Crystal cards in front of them in any order,
and receives 3 new troops, or 4 if they control the Heart of Eden,
which they may freely place on any of their territories.
They are also free to move troops across the borders
between their territories.

To gain time, the Reinforcements phase is generally performed by all players
at the same time, except if some of them want to base their choices on the previous players'.


# Combat

As was said in the Expansion Phase section, a player may during their turn
start a battle on up to 2 fronts by playing a unit on those fronts.
This section is about what happens after that.

## Simplest case: a player attacks another player's territory on one front.

Starting with the attacking player (when he starts the battle),
both players take turns playing unit cards from their hands, one at a time.
When one of them cannot continue doing so, or doesn't want to,
they lose their right to play unit cards until the end of the battle,
while the other player is free to keep playing any number of unit
cards from their hand, until they too cannot or do not want to continue
(note: while the attacking player has to play at least one unit card on a front
to start the battle on that front,
it is possible for the defending player not to play any unit card).

Units played by each player during the battle are placed in front of that player,
making up the attacking and defending armies.
Within an army, a players unit are placed in the order they were played,
from top to bottom.
A unit's position within its army is referred to as that unit's row.
By default there is only one unit per row, but some abilities
(see Abilities section) may move units from one row to another,
allowing several units to be on the left or right of each other, on the same row
(note: if moving a unit leaves a row empty,
all units below it move up a row so that there is no empty row).

Once both players have stopped adding units to their armies,
the strength of each army is determined by summing the strength of all units
in that army, which allows to determined the winner (see Expansion phase section).

After the winner has been determined,
both players discard all the units from their armies,
from the first row to the last, from left to right on each row.

The defending player may also discard any number of cards from their hand,
then replenish it to 5 cards.


## Attacking another player's territories on two fronts

When attacking another player's territories on two fronts,
everything happens mostly like when attacking only one territory on one front,
but this time the players create a separate attacking army and defending army for each front.

Players still take turn playing unit cards from their hands, one at a time,
starting from the attacking player, but with two differences:

- when playing a unit, the player chooses on which of the two fronts that unit must be added,
  i.e. which army it will join
- during their first turn, instead of playing 1 unit card on a front of their choice,
  the attacking player must play 1 unit card on each front


## Attacking two territories belonging to different players

When attacking territories from 2 different players at once,
everything happens mostly like when attacking only one territory on one front,
but this time again the players create a separate attacking army and defending army for each front.

Players still take turn playing unit cards from their hands (following turn order), one at a time,
starting from the attacking player, but with two differences:

- when playing a unit, the attacking player chooses on which of the two fronts that unit must be added,
  i.e. which army it will join
- during their first turn, instead of playing 1 unit card on a front of their choice,
  the attacking player must play 1 unit card on each front


## Attacking a wild territory (i.e. a territory that no player controls)

If one or more of the territories that a player attacks are wild territories,
everything happens as if that territory was controlled by a player
that chose not to play any unit card.

Then, when determining the defending army's strength,
the wild territory's strength is determined by counting the number of tile
between that territory and the closest portal territory and multiplying that number by 2
(e.g. if there are 2 tiles between the wild territory and the closest portal,
then that territory's strength is 4 and the attacking player needs an army
of strength 5 or more to conquer it).


# Cards effects

## Permanent effects

In Battle For Eden many cards,
whether they're unit cards, common cards or technology cards,
have additional rules applying to them called permanent effects.

Some of them are explicitly optional. Those are usually beneficial effects,
giving their player new options
(ex: "If an ability reveals this card, you may choose to discard it and reveal another card instead").

In the general case however, permanent effects are not optional,
whether they're beneficial effects (ex: "+1 strength if your hand is empty")
or detrimental effects limiting the player's options
(ex: "This unit can only be returned to its player's world by being destroyed during combat").


## Abilities

The units that a player adds to a battle generally do more than just add strength
to their army, and allow their player to trigger various effects if they want to.

Abilities are divided into 4 types, depending on when they can be triggered:

- **immediate abilities** may be triggered just after a unit has been added to the battle
  (until it's the next player's turn to play a unit from their hand)
- **delayed abilities** may be triggered after all players have stopped
  playing units from their hands (before the strength of each army is tallied)
- **post-combat abilities** may be triggered just after the strength
  of each army has been tallied (before the unit cards are discarded)
- **reaction abilities** may be triggered:
   - if they're **event-based**: just after a specific event happens
                                 (until it's the next player's turn to play a unit from their hand)
                                 and possibly several times during the same turn
                                 (example event: "this unit collapses")
   - if they're **condition-based**: as if it was based on the event
                                     "the condition became satisfied",
                                     as well as if it was an immediate ability if the condition
                                     was already satisfied when the card was added to the battle
                                     (example condition: "your hand is empty")

Keep in mind that using an ability is always optional,
and that the player may always choose in which order to trigger their units' abilities.
If several players want to trigger an ability at the same time,
the priority follows turn order, starting from the attacking player.


## Common effects from abilities

Many civilization rely on mechanics specific to that civilization,
which are described in that civilization's World.

There are however also mechanics common to several civilization,
which we'll describe here.

- "Destroying a card" means putting that card back where is was purchased from
  (whether a pile of common or technology cards, or the civilization's World).

- "Getting rid of a unit" means choosing a unit and making it collapse,
  i.e. removing it from the battle. A player's collapsed unit are stacked
  into a face-up pile in the order they collapsed,
  which is put in the player's discard pile after the battle,
  just before the remaining unit cards are discarded.
  When a cost-5 unit collapses, it is immediately destroyed
  unless its player spends 1 troop on that front,
  which they are only allowed to do if it leaves at least
  1 attacking troop near the frontier and 1 defending troop on the territory.
