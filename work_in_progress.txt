 => attack deck?
 => deck construction rules? /!\ it has to be slumbering at first, with few strong cards and lots of trash cards
 => exact rules for moving the dragon, exact winnin/losing conditions? (lots of victories needed to win, destruction of 1 Portal enough to lose?)
 => the dragon awakens on round 3, and attacks each turn the user-controlled territory which is closest to the Heart of Eden... 1/player? 1 and continues in a straight line? 1 and attacks neighbouring territories?
